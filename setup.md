In order to follow this lesson you will require 2 things: R and RStudio. R is the actual programming language. It translates the commands you write into something your computer can understand. RStudio is just a shiny new hood on R. It is more user-friendly and provides some useful tools to write and organize R code. We will learn more about these tools during the course.

For now, it is important that you download both of these tools:

## Software Setup

### R
To download R, go to CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network, https://cloud.r-project.org. A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2-3 minor releases each year. It’s a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions that require you to re-install all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse. I recommend you download the latest version of R (currently R-4.4.2).

### RStudio
RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming, which you can download from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year, and it will automatically let you know when a new version is out, so there’s no need to check back. It’s a good idea to upgrade regularly to take advantage of the latest and greatest features.

When you start RStudio, you’ll see two key regions in the interface: the console pane and the output pane. For now, all you need to know is that you type the R code in the console pane and press enter to run it. You’ll learn more as we go along!

## Data 
<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
We will make use of some data available in R packages as well as data from real experiments run by me or my colleagues.

I will provide the data you need at each time point, you can then easily download the required data. If you want to download all data beforehand, download the [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) and unzip it to your desktop.
