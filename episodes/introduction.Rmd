## Introduction
This is the accompanying website to the Empra Differentielle Psychologie of Heidelberg University. It is authored and used by [Sven Lesche](https://www.psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de/person/sven-lesche). This course aims to cover:

- Some R basics and how to structure code
- Getting a first glimpse of data
- Cleaning data
- Running some analysis

## Lesson Structure
The entire course is organized in short "Episodes" intended to take around 10-15mins to read and around 5-10mins to complete the challenges below. You will complete approximately one episode per week.
At the end of each episode, you will upload a script containing the solutions to the challenges.
The file format should be: `lessonnumber_solutions_name_surname.R`.
Upload your solutions to a HeiBox folder.

## Accompanying Material
This course relies heavily on [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), which can be treated as an accompanying textbook.
